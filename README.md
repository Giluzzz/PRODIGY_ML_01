House Value Prediction

Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and number of their bedrooms and bathrooms

To implement a linear regression model to predict the house values import necessary libraries, load the dataset and preprocess the data to ensure their is no missing values. Then built and train the linear regression model with the training data and make predictions. To evaluate the performance of the designed codel the common metrics such as mean square error and R-squared is used.
